  <p>aahhhh i miss playing in bands sooooo much..!</p>

  <p>looking back i've continuously been playing in bands from 15-35. i really think this is what i've been missing the past while.</p>

  <p>a big part of that i think is that every band i've been in has always been with my close friends, and has always been a linchpin in friends-becoming-family.</p>
