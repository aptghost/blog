  <h1>my fight stick comes in tomorrow</h1>
  <p>yesterday i watched this staged bbc special from 1992 called GHOSTWATCH. it aired on halloween night and was presented as a real thing. it even stars well known bbc journalists from the time. people watching at home went NUTS thinking it was real. phone-lines were flooded at the bbc with folks trying to call and and be like "wtf" but unable to get through (actually imitating a part of the special, making things even worse). bbc had to later apologize and has never aired the special since then. holy shit.</p>

  <p>now a days it definitely feels a little dated, but it's also the progenitor of almost all found footage style horror flicks, predating blair witch and other indie found footage by a wide margin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/Ghostwatch">well worth a watch!</a></p>
